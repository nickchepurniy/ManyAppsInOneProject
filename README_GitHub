    (A) (1) Project 'ManyAppsInOneProject' was created using expo command in the
            (HOME) subdirectory REACT_NATIVE:
                expo init ManyAppsInOneProject
                (with template: expo-template-bare-typescript )
            To run above project (using the created App.tsx file):
                cd ManyAppsInOneProject
                yarn web  (OR  expo r -c )

            The App.tsx was moved to App_ORIGINAL.tsx because we will copy into App.tsx 
            one of the files listed below:

        (2) The idea here is to copy one of the files listed below into App.tsx and use
            the command: 

                yarn web
            
            instead of creating a project directory for each of the files listed here:

              App_Lights_Version2.tsx      // first Functional App Component
              App_QuadraticVersion4.tsx    // gets roots of a quadratic from coeff and vice-versa
              App_SVG_03WithMain.tsx       // displays the 44 test plots used in App_Quadratic
              App_Several_Steps_Vers2.tsx  // train schedule for several stations
              App_Magic_Squares.tsx        // shows how to get basic solution of 3x3 Magic Square
              App649_Version2.tsx          // verifies a 6/49 lotto ticket against 10 draws
              AppRenderArrayWithMap.tsx    // uses a handle function for each element in array
              AppRenderArrayWithMap_V2.tsx // uses a single handle function for all elements
              App_Anim00.tsx               // Simple Animated.timing using one circle
              App_Anim01_vers3.tsx         // Animated.timing used for three circles
              App_Anim04_v5.tsx            // Circle draggable or click-positioned at new location
              App_FC_setState.tsx          // useEffect toggled to illustrate how to use it
              App_CC_setState.tsx          // add 2 numbers and claculate sum using class components

        (3) Creaated subdirectory App_A under ManyAppsInOneProject and copied into it several files
            required by the main Apps in directory ManyAppsInOneProject. Added special components to
            dir node_modules (using the yarn command) ch are required by the main Apps, such as:

                yarn add react-native-paper   
                yarn add react-native-svg

    (B) GitHub the 'ManyAppsInOneProject' project
    
    (C) AFter cloning from GitHub into another user's computer you will be required to install
        the module `expo` using command:

                yarn add expo
